The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer in revamping a non-profit website, Changing Lives, then building two entirely new website Leenda Bolden coaching site) within the same environment, which led to overwriting previous work. The AI engineer demonstrated proficiency in React/FastAPI development, debugging with a troubleshoot agent, and iteratively refining features based on user feedback. Key decisions involved using Tailwind for styling, managing photo content (uploading, categorizing, watermarking, ensuring unique and properly aspect-ratioed images), and adjusting branding elements. The shift to multiple projects highlights a critical architectural challenge of working in a shared environment without separate project isolation, necessitating restoration efforts. The current state is an ongoing restoration of the Changing Lives website, coupled with specific design modifications and a reported error.

The primary user request was to revamp their non-profit website, www.snatchedbeautieschanginglives.org, to be more engaging and inviting. This involved:
1.  **Initial Revamp**: Create a modern, engaging website using provided authentic photos (school supplies, community outreach).
2.  **Photo Management**: Add more photos, fix positioning, create an interactive gallery with categories and modal view, ensure no duplicates or cut-offs, maintain correct aspect ratios, and watermark all photos with Â© Changing Lives. Remove any photos with timestamps.
3.  **Branding**: Integrate official logos (pink circular, then a new pink/magenta one), adjust header text hierarchy (Changing Lives as main, Snatched Beauties smaller).
4.  **Content Refinement**: Update mission statement (nationwide reach), update program categories and images.
5.  **Functionality**: Ensure social media links are working (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter), volunteer signup is functional, and contact information (phone: 323-613-5153, email: sbchlvs@gmail.com, address: 5710 W. Manchester save Ste 211 B Los Angeles Ca 90045) is correct and clickable.
6.  **Deployment Guidance**: Instructions on how to deploy the website, specifically using Netlify, after confirming the Changing Lives domain exists.
7.  **Subsequent Projects**:
    *   **The Planet Discovery**: Engaging travel website with global reach, fun, colorful, earthy adventure theme, language options (English, Tunsi, Igbo, Arabic, Hebrew, French, Spanish), photo gallery, and contact forms.
    *   **Empowered by Leenda**: Professional coaching website for NLP practitioner Leenda Bolden, client-converting, with service offerings, pricing packages, contact/booking forms, and professional photos.
The current work involves restoring the Changing Lives website with specific changes: removing the adventure travel gallery, updating contact info, removing all gradients and purple colors, removing Book free consultation and book an appointment text, and removing arrows from buttons.
